/*
 * Macros that are used to mark functions signatures.
 *
 *  VWL_VKAPI_CALL        - Replaces the return type of the function. Use to mark functions to use the expected
 *                          Vulkan calling conventions.
 *  VWL_CAPI_CALL         - Replaces the return type of the function. Use to mark other non-Vulkan functions
 *                          that should use the C calling convention, such as callbacks implemented in C++ that
 *                          are used by C code.
 *  VWL_API_POST          - Placed at the end of the function signature. These will typically be
 *                          functions that need to be callable from C.
 *  VWL_VKAPI_EXPORT      - Marks that the symbol should use the "default" visibility
